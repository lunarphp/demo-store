# Starter Kit

This repository is provided as a reference to learn how to use Lunar Laravel E-Commerce package. This example is a classic e-commerce store.

> **Warning**
> This application is purely an example of how you can implement Lunar headless e-commerce for Laravel. It is not production ready or complete.

This demo store uses MySQL as the Scout driver. This is not the recommended approach for a production environment, but it works well for development.
